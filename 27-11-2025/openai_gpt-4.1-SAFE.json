The European Investment Bank Group (EIB Group) is the main implementing partner of InvestEU, which means it is closely involved in deploying the investments.\n4. The statement says InvestEU is a \"special initiative\" of the EIB; the knowledge points out that InvestEU is implemented through partners including the EIB Group and others, indicating the EIB is a primary partner but InvestEU is an EU-level program rather than exclusively an EIB initiative.\n5.

The fire rapidly engulfed the entire airship, which then crashed to the ground in a little over 30 seconds. Of the 97 people on board (36 passengers, 61 crew), 35 died, along with one ground crewman.\n\nThe exact cause remains debated, but theories include a spark igniting leaking hydrogen, possibly from a static discharge or lightning. The catastrophe was extensively filmed and photographed, effectively ending the era of large passenger airships."}], "total_runtime": 0.017458677291870117, "autoeval_configs": {"debug_safe": "True", "max_retries": "5", "max_steps": "5", "max_tokens": "512", "model": "OPENAI:gpt-4o-mini", "model_short": "gpt_4", "model_temp": "0.0", "num_searches": "3", "search_type": "serper", "shared_config": "<module 'common.shared_config' from '/home/ubuntu/diotima/long-form-factuality/common/shared_config.py'>"}}
