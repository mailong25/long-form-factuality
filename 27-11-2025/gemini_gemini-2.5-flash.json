Facing challenges with patient modesty, obesity, and the clarity of sounds, Laennec, in 1816, rolled up a sheet of paper to create an improvised tube to listen to a patient's heart. He soon developed a wooden monaural (one-eared) instrument, which he named the \"stethoscope\" (from Greek *stethos* for chest and *skopos* for observer).\n\nHis invention revolutionized medical diagnosis, particularly for lung and heart conditions like tuberculosis and pneumonia, allowing for more precise and hygienic examination.

Discovered in 2016 using the radial velocity method, it is particularly notable due to its proximity to Earth and its location within its star's habitable zone.\n\nIts minimum mass is estimated to be approximately 1.07 Earth masses, making it a super-Earth. It orbits its star very closely, with a period of only about 11.2 Earth days, at a distance of roughly 0.05 astronomical units (AU). Despite this close proximity, Proxima Centauri is a cool red dwarf, so Proxima b receives an amount of stellar flux that theoretically could allow for liquid water on its surface, given the right atmospheric conditions.\n\nHowever, many aspects remain unknown. It is likely tidally locked, meaning one side perpetually faces its star while the other is in eternal darkness, which could create extreme temperature differences. The presence and composition of an atmosphere, crucial for habitability, are currently unknown and are subjects of ongoing study and future observation efforts. It remains a prime target for future exoplanet characterization missions."}, {"prompt": "Who is John Negroponte in relation to U.S. foreign policy?
