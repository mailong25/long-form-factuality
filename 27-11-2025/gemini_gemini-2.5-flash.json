Established in 1958, its primary mission is to finance projects that support EU policies, foster economic growth, create jobs, and promote climate action within Europe and globally.\n\nThe EIB operates on a non-profit basis, borrowing large volumes on capital markets and lending at favourable rates to public and private sector projects. It is the world's largest multilateral lender, making significant investments in key areas such as innovation, infrastructure (transport, energy, digital), climate action, and environmental sustainability. It also supports small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through various financial instruments.\n\nAs the EU's climate bank, the EIB is committed to channelling a growing share of its financing towards green investments, aiming to support the European Green Deal and facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy."}, {"prompt": "What happened in the incident of the Hindenburg disaster?

The fire rapidly engulfed the entire airship, which then crashed to the ground in a little over 30 seconds. Of the 97 people on board (36 passengers, 61 crew), 35 died, along with one ground crewman.\n\nThe exact cause remains debated, but theories include a spark igniting leaking hydrogen, possibly from a static discharge or lightning. The catastrophe was extensively filmed and photographed, effectively ending the era of large passenger airships."}], "total_runtime": 3.2906298637390137}
