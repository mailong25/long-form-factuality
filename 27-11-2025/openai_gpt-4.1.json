Founded in 1958 under the Treaty of Rome, it provides financing for projects that support EU policy goals, such as climate action, innovation, infrastructure, and social cohesion.\n\nThe EIB raises funds on capital markets (issuing bonds) and lends at favorable rates to both public and private sectors. Key priorities include:\n- Climate & sustainability (aiming for 50%+ of financing to support green projects by 2025).\n- Innovation & SMEs (via loans, guarantees, and venture capital).\n- Cohesion & development (reducing regional disparities).\n- Digital transformation and strategic autonomy (e.g., semiconductors, energy security).\n\nIt operates globally but focuses on Europe, with special initiatives like the InvestEU program (mobilizing \u20ac372 billion in investment by 2027). The EIB also manages the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and supports Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction.\n\nHeadquartered in Luxembourg, it works closely with the European Commission and other EU bodies. The EIB Group includes the European Investment Fund (EIF), which specializes in SME support.\n\nCriticisms include bureaucracy and debates over fossil fuel financing (though it ended most such projects in 2021). The EIB remains a key player in EU economic resilience."}, {"prompt": "What happened in the incident of the Hindenburg disaster?

The fire rapidly engulfed the entire airship, which then crashed to the ground in a little over 30 seconds. Of the 97 people on board (36 passengers, 61 crew), 35 died, along with one ground crewman.\n\nThe exact cause remains debated, but theories include a spark igniting leaking hydrogen, possibly from a static discharge or lightning. The catastrophe was extensively filmed and photographed, effectively ending the era of large passenger airships."}], "total_runtime": 0.017458677291870117}
