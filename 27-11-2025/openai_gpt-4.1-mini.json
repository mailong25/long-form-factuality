Founded in 1958 under the Treaty of Rome, it provides financing for projects that support EU policy goals, such as climate action, innovation, infrastructure, and economic cohesion.\n\nThe EIB raises funds on capital markets (issuing bonds) and lends at favorable rates to both public and private sectors. Key priorities include:\n- Climate & sustainability (aiming for 50%+ of financing to be climate-related by 2025).\n- Innovation & SMEs (via loans, guarantees, and venture capital).\n- Infrastructure (transport, energy, digital).\n- Social projects (housing, education, healthcare).\n\nIt operates globally but focuses on Europe, with special initiatives like the InvestEU Program (mobilizing \u20ac372 billion, 2021\u20132027). The European Investment Fund (EIF), its subsidiary, supports SMEs and startups.\n\nThe EIB is AAA-rated, allowing it to borrow cheaply and pass savings to borrowers. Governed by a Board of Governors (EU finance ministers) and a Management Committee, it maintains political independence while aligning with EU objectives.\n\nHeadquartered in Luxembourg, it\u2019s the world\u2019s largest multilateral lender, with over \u20ac1 trillion invested since 1958."}, {"prompt": "What happened in the incident of the Hindenburg disaster?

As ground crew secured mooring lines, the ship suddenly ignited and the hydrogen-filled hull burned and collapsed in less than a minute. Of the 97 people on board and ground personnel nearby, 36 died and the rest survived, many injured. The dramatic newsreel and radio report by Herbert Morrison (\"Oh, the humanity!\") made the disaster iconic. The exact ignition source is still debated, but a hydrogen leak ignited\u2014likely by a spark from static electricity or a discharge."}], "total_runtime": 0.09470987319946289}
