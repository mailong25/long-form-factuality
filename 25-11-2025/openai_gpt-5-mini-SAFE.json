Compare the STATEMENT with the KNOWLEDGE:\n   - The KNOWLEDGE explicitly states that the Hindenburg disaster marked the end of the era of passenger-carrying airships.\n   - It also mentions that the disaster shattered public confidence and led to the abrupt end of the airship era.\n   - Therefore, the statement is strongly implied and supported by the KNOWLEDGE.\n\nRestated STATEMENT: The Hindenburg disaster marked the end of the airship era for passenger travel.\n\nFinal answer: [Supported]", "answer": "Supported"}, "annotation": "Supported"}], "revised_fact_jsonified_all": [{"atomic_fact": "The German airship LZ 129 Hindenburg was attempting to dock at Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey.", "revised_fact": "The subject in the statement \"The German airship LZ 129 Hindenburg was attempting to dock at Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey\" is \"The German airship LZ 129 Hindenburg\". This is already a clear and specific reference to a known entity mentioned explicitly in the RESPONSE with its full name. Similarly, \"Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey\" is a clear and specific location mentioned clearly in the RESPONSE.\n\nThere are no vague references or pronouns that need to be replaced in the statement.

Specifically, the RESPONSE states that the EIB \"aims to align its operations with the Paris Agreement and target a large share of financing for climate and biodiversity projects,\" directly relating to the STATEMENT.\n5. This clearly explains how the EIB's strategy includes targeting financing for biodiversity projects, establishing a direct relationship between the QUESTION (about EIB) and the STATEMENT (about EIB's aim regarding biodiversity financing).\n\nTherefore, the subjects of the QUESTION and the STATEMENT are [Foo]."}, {"atomic_fact": "The bank benefits from a strong credit rating.", "revised_fact": "The subject in the statement \"The bank benefits from a strong credit rating\" is \"The bank\".

Therefore, \"The bank\" should be replaced by \"The European Investment Bank (EIB)\" in the revised statement.\n\n```\nThe European Investment Bank (EIB) benefits from a strong credit rating.\n```", "is_relevant": "The subject of the QUESTION is the European Investment Bank (EIB). The subject of the STATEMENT is the European Investment Bank (EIB) as well.\n\nThe RESPONSE explains the role, activities, and characteristics of the EIB and specifically states that \"The European Investment Bank (EIB) benefits from a strong credit rating.\" This directly relates the statement about the EIB's credit rating to the broader description of the EIB in the question.

Therefore, we should replace \"The strong credit rating\" with \"The European Investment Bank's (EIB) strong credit rating\" to provide a specific subject.

The subject of the STATEMENT is also the European Investment Bank's (EIB) strong credit rating.\n\nThe RESPONSE explains that the EIB \"raises funds on capital markets and benefits from a strong credit rating, allowing concessional financing and long maturities.\" This clearly explains how the EIB\u2019s strong credit rating relates to concessional financing\u2014the credit rating enables it.

The subject of the STATEMENT is also the European Investment Bank's (EIB) work. \n\nThe RESPONSE mentions that \"Its work complements EU budgetary tools to mobilise public and private investment across Europe and beyond,\" which explicitly explains how the EIB's activities relate to EU budgetary tools.

Since \"EU budgetary tools\" is not further specified or a pronoun, it is not inherently vague in this context. Therefore, the statement remains accurate with the original phrase, but to ensure clarity, replacing \"public investment\" with \"public and private investment across Europe and beyond\" aligns better with the RESPONSE.\n\nRevised statement with minimal necessary modification:\n```\nEU budgetary tools mobilise public and private investment across Europe and beyond.\n```", "is_relevant": "Step 1: Identify the broad subject of the QUESTION and the STATEMENT.\n\n- The QUESTION asks about the European Investment Bank (EIB).\n- The STATEMENT is about \"EU budgetary tools mobilising public and private investment across Europe and beyond.\"\n\nStep 2: Determine the subject of the RESPONSE.\n\n- The RESPONSE primarily describes the EIB, its role, functions, and its relationship with EU policy tools.\n- It states, \"Its work complements EU budgetary tools to mobilise public and private investment across Europe and beyond.\"\n- This sentence directly links the EIB's work with EU budgetary tools and their shared goal of mobilising investment.\n\nStep 3: Analyze whether the RESPONSE explains the relationship between the two subjects.\n\n- The RESPONSE explains that the European Investment Bank complements EU budgetary tools.\n- That is, the EIB and EU budgetary tools are coordinated or work together to mobilise investment.\n- Since the RESPONSE explicitly explains how the EIB relates to EU budgetary tools, the subjects European Investment Bank (QUESTION) and EU budgetary tools (STATEMENT) are related.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\n- The broad subject of the QUESTION is the European Investment Bank.\n- The broad subject of the STATEMENT is EU budgetary tools.\n- The RESPONSE explicitly states the relationship between the EIB and EU budgetary tools\u2014how they complement each other to mobilise investments.\n- Therefore, the subjects are [Foo].\n\nFinal answer:  \nThe broad subject of the QUESTION is the European Investment Bank. The broad subject of the STATEMENT is EU budgetary tools. The RESPONSE explains that the EIB's work complements EU budgetary tools to mobilise public and private investment, thus clarifying the relationship between these two subjects. Therefore, the subjects are [Foo]."}, {"atomic_fact": "EU budgetary tools mobilise private investment.", "revised_fact": "The subject in the statement \"EU budgetary tools mobilise private investment\" is \"EU budgetary tools.\" From the RESPONSE, the phrase \"EU budgetary tools\" appears in the sentence \"Its work complements EU budgetary tools to mobilise public and private investment across Europe and beyond.\" Here, the RESPONSE also clarifies that the European Investment Bank (EIB) complements these EU budgetary tools. The statement refers only to \"mobilising private investment,\" but the RESPONSE indicates they mobilise both public and private investment. The statement only claims that EU budgetary tools mobilise private investment, so we keep that. Since \"EU budgetary tools\" is clear and specific enough within this context, referring to financial tools of the European Union, it is not a vague reference requiring replacement.\n\nThus, the revised statement is:\n```\nEU budgetary tools mobilise private investment.\n```", "is_relevant": "The subject of the QUESTION is the European Investment Bank (EIB).

Since the statement directly references the \"EU budgetary tools\" and these are clearly described in the RESPONSE, the subject \"EU budgetary tools\" is not vague and does not need further expansion. The statement does not contain pronouns or incomplete names that need replacement.\n\nThus, the revised statement is:\n```\nEU budgetary tools mobilise investment across Europe.\n```", "is_relevant": "The subject of the QUESTION is the European Investment Bank (EIB).

The statement itself is a general one and uses \"EU budgetary tools\" as a proper noun phrase. Thus, \"EU budgetary tools\" is not vague within this context, and no additional modification is needed for it.\n\nTherefore, the original statement is already clear and does not contain vague references that can be resolved with information from the RESPONSE.\n\n```\nEU budgetary tools mobilise investment beyond Europe.\n```", "is_relevant": "Step 1: Identify the broad subject of the QUESTION:\nThe QUESTION asks about the European Investment Bank (EIB).
