The fire rapidly engulfed the entire craft within approximately 34 seconds, causing it to crash to the ground.\n\nTragically, 35 people on board (13 passengers and 22 crew members) and one ground crewman were killed. While the exact cause remains debated, theories range from a static electricity spark igniting leaking hydrogen to sabotage. The disaster marked the end of the airship era for passenger transport."}, {"prompt": "Can you tell me about the European Investment Bank?
