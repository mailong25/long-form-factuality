The project was launched in 1998 by three scientists, Tony Greenwald from the University of Washington, Mahzarin Banaji from Harvard University, and Brian Nosek from the University of Virginia. \n\nThe goal of Project Implicit is to investigate thoughts and feelings that exist either outside of conscious awareness or outside of conscious control. These are known as implicit biases, which are often different from what people explicitly say they believe. The project seeks to understand the underlying causes and impacts of these biases on various aspects of life, such as decision making, behavior, and attitudes towards different social groups. \n\nThe project uses a tool called the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure implicit biases. The IAT measures the strength of associations between concepts (e.g., black people, gay people) and evaluations (e.g., good, bad) or stereotypes (e.g., athletic, clumsy). By comparing response times in associating these concepts, the IAT can provide an indication of implicit bias.\n\nFor instance, if a participant is quicker to associate 'black people' with 'bad' and 'white people' with 'good' than the reverse, this might indicate an implicit racial bias. Similarly, if a participant is quicker to associate 'women' with 'home' and 'men' with 'career' than the reverse, this might indicate an implicit gender bias.\n\nThe data collected through the IAT has been used in numerous research studies to explore the prevalence and impact of implicit biases. The project has also developed educational materials and resources to help individuals and organizations understand and address implicit biases.\n\nProject Implicit is hosted by Harvard University and is a collaboration between researchers from Harvard University, the University of Virginia, and the University of Washington. It has attracted millions of participants worldwide, making it one of the largest online behavioral research projects.\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.
