He is most widely known as \"the father of modern pathology\" for his concept of cellular pathology. \n\nBorn on October 13, 1821, in Schivelbein, Pomerania, Kingdom of Prussia (now \u015awidwin, Poland), Virchow studied medicine and chemistry in Berlin at the Military Academy of Medicine, from which he graduated in 1843. \n\nIn 1845, he became an assistant at the Charit\u00e9 hospital in Berlin. During this time, he developed his concept of cellular pathology, stating that all diseases originate from cells. This was a significant development, as it contradicted the prevalent belief that diseases arose from imbalances in the body's systems. \n\nVirchow made significant contributions to the understanding of thrombosis and embolism, coining the term 'thrombosis' and developing the concept of embolism. He was the first to explain that a pulmonary embolism was caused by blood clots originating from veins in the legs or pelvis, a condition now known as deep vein thrombosis.\n\nIn 1856, he became a professor at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin, where he continued his research and teaching. \n\nVirchow was also a social reformer, advocating for public health and education. He was elected to the Berlin City Council in 1859 and the Prussian House of Representatives in 1862. He played a significant role in developing the German Health Care system and was instrumental in the establishment of Germany's first meat inspection law, which set the precedent for regulating food safety.\n\nIn addition to his work in medicine and politics, Virchow was also a prolific writer and editor. He founded the medical journal \"Archiv f\u00fcr pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und f\u00fcr klinische Medizin\" (now known as \"Virchows Archiv\") in 1847, which is still published today. \n\nRudolf Virchow died on September 5, 1902, in Berlin, Germany. His work continues to be influential in the fields of medicine and public health."}], "total_runtime": 96.72160768508911, "autoeval_configs": {"debug_safe": "True", "max_retries": "3", "max_steps": "3", "max_tokens": "512", "model": "OPENAI:gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "model_short": "gpt_35_turbo", "model_temp": "0.1", "num_searches": "3", "search_type": "serper", "shared_config": "<module 'common.shared_config' from '/mnt/storage/longmai/diotima/long-form-factuality/common/shared_config.py'>"}}
