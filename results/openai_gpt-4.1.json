The airship, filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas, suddenly ignited, causing a massive fire that quickly engulfed the entire structure. Of the 97 people on board, 36 passengers and crew, along with one worker on the ground, died. The disaster was widely publicized due to dramatic newsreel footage and photographs, as well as the famous radio broadcast by reporter Herbert Morrison, who exclaimed, \"Oh, the humanity!\" The exact cause of the fire remains uncertain, but theories include static electricity, a spark, or sabotage. The tragedy marked the end of the airship era for passenger travel, as public confidence in the safety of dirigibles was shattered."}, {"prompt": "Can you tell me about the European Investment Bank?
