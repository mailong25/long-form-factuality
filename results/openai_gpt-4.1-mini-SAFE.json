From the RESPONSE, we see that the European Investment Bank (EIB) supports projects that contribute to EU policy goals, including climate action, and that the bank prioritizes projects that align with the EU\u2019s climate targets. Therefore, \"the projects\" refers to the projects supported or prioritized by the European Investment Bank (EIB). Thus, the revised statement is:\n\n```\nThe projects supported by the European Investment Bank (EIB) align with the EU\u2019s climate targets.\n```", "is_relevant": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The subject of the QUESTION is the European Investment Bank (EIB).\n2.

The RESPONSE explains that the EIB supports projects that contribute to EU policy goals, including climate action, and that the bank prioritizes projects that align with the EU\u2019s climate targets.\n4. This explanation directly relates the EIB (the subject of the QUESTION) to the projects it supports and how those projects align with the EU\u2019s climate targets (the subject of the STATEMENT).\n5.

This is not vague because the RESPONSE clearly defines the EIB as the European Investment Bank and describes its role in supporting economic development.\n- \"EU values\" is a vague reference because \"EU\" is an abbreviation for the European Union, and \"values\" is a general term. From the RESPONSE, it is clear that \"EU values\" refers to the values and objectives of the European Union.\n\nTherefore, the vague reference \"EU values\" should be replaced with \"the values and objectives of the European Union\" to be more precise.\n\nRevised statement:\n```\nThe economic development supported by the European Investment Bank (EIB) is consistent with the values and objectives of the European Union.\n```", "is_relevant": "Step 1: Identify the broad subject of the QUESTION.  \nThe QUESTION asks about the European Investment Bank (EIB).

The STATEMENT explicitly states that the economic development supported by the EIB aligns with the EU\u2019s values and objectives. This shows a direct explanation of how the economic development supported by the EIB relates to the EU\u2019s values and objectives.\n\nSince the RESPONSE contains information that explains how the economic development supported by the EIB is consistent with the EU\u2019s values and objectives, the subjects of the STATEMENT (economic development supported by EIB and EU values/objectives) and the QUESTION (EIB) are related through this explanation.\n\nTherefore, the subjects should be considered [Foo].\n\nFinal answer: [Foo]"}, {"atomic_fact": "The economic development supported by the EIB is consistent with EU objectives.", "revised_fact": "The subject in the statement \"The economic development supported by the EIB is consistent with EU objectives\" includes \"The economic development supported by the EIB\" and \"EU objectives.\" \n\n- \"The economic development supported by the EIB\" is a phrase that refers to the economic development that the European Investment Bank (EIB) helps to foster through its financing and investment activities.\n- \"EU objectives\" is a vague reference to the goals or policy goals of the European Union (EU).\n\nFrom the RESPONSE, the EIB supports projects that contribute to EU policy goals and acts as a catalyst for investment supporting economic development consistent with EU values and objectives. Therefore, \"EU objectives\" should be replaced with \"European Union (EU) objectives\" for clarity.\n\nThus, the revised statement is:\n\n```\nThe economic development supported by the European Investment Bank (EIB) is consistent with European Union (EU) objectives.\n```", "is_relevant": "Step 1: Identify the broad subject of the QUESTION.  \nThe QUESTION asks about the \"European Investment Bank,\" so the broad subject of the QUESTION is the European Investment Bank (EIB).\n\nStep 2: Identify the broad subject of the STATEMENT.  \nThe STATEMENT says, \"The economic development supported by the European Investment Bank (EIB) is consistent with European Union (EU) objectives.\" The broad subject here involves two entities: the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Union (EU) objectives.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the RESPONSE explains how the subjects of the QUESTION (EIB) and the STATEMENT (EIB and EU objectives) are related.  \nThe RESPONSE states that the EIB is the lending arm of the European Union, owned by EU member states, and aims to support projects that contribute to EU policy goals. It also says the EIB supports economic development consistent with EU values and objectives. This clearly explains the relationship between the EIB and the EU objectives, showing that the economic development supported by the EIB aligns with EU goals.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion  \nSince the RESPONSE contains information explaining how the EIB (subject of the QUESTION) supports economic development consistent with EU objectives (subject of the STATEMENT), the subjects are related in the RESPONSE.\n\nTherefore, the subjects of the QUESTION and the STATEMENT are [Foo]."}], "past_steps_jsonified_all": [{"google_searches": [{"query": "European Investment Bank projects contribution to EU policy goals", "result": "EIB-backed projects bring the greatest financial contribution to goals involving the sectors in which the Bank has traditionally been the most active.
