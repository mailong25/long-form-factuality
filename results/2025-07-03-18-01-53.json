He is best known for developing a form of semiotic analysis known as deconstruction, which he discussed in numerous texts, and developed in the context of phenomenology. He is one of the major figures associated with post-structuralism and postmodern philosophy.\n\nDerrida was educated at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, where he studied philosophy and became associated with the structuralist movement, influenced by figures like Ferdinand de Saussure and Claude Levi-Strauss. He also studied under phenomenologists like Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Jean Hyppolite, who influenced his early thought.\n\nIn 1962, Derrida published his first three books, which would make a significant impact on the intellectual life of the time. These were \"Writing and Difference,\" \"Speech and Phenomena,\" and \"Of Grammatology,\" which is perhaps his most famous work. In these books, he developed his theory of deconstruction, which involves the close reading of texts in order to expose and subvert their underlying assumptions about language, meaning, and the world.\n\nDerrida's work had a profound influence on a wide range of disciplines, including philosophy, literature, law, anthropology, historiography, applied linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychoanalysis, and political theory. He was a prolific writer and public speaker, with his works and lectures touching on themes such as language, meaning, metaphysics, ethics, and politics.\n\nDerrida also held teaching positions at several institutions, most notably the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris and the University of California, Irvine in the United States. He was awarded honorary doctorates by multiple universities, including Cambridge University in 1992.\n\nDerrida was married to psychoanalyst Marguerite Aucouturier, with whom he had two sons. He died on October 9, 2004, in Paris, from pancreatic cancer. His death was a significant event in the intellectual world, prompting tributes and reflections on his life and work from scholars around the globe."}, {"prompt": "What is the goal of Project Implicit, an online research project on implicit social cognition? Provide as many specific details and examples as possible (such as names of people, numbers, events, locations, dates, times, etc.)", "correct_answers": [], "incorrect_answers": [], "side1_response": "[PLACEHOLDER RESPONSE]", "side2_response": "Project Implicit is an online research project that aims to educate the public about hidden biases and to provide a \u201cvirtual laboratory\u201d for collecting data on the internet. The project was launched in 1998 by three scientists, Tony Greenwald from the University of Washington, Mahzarin Banaji from Harvard University, and Brian Nosek from the University of Virginia. \n\nThe goal of Project Implicit is to investigate thoughts and feelings that exist either outside of conscious awareness or outside of conscious control. These are known as implicit biases, which are often different from what people explicitly say they believe. The project seeks to understand the underlying causes and impacts of these biases on various aspects of life, such as decision making, behavior, and attitudes towards different social groups. \n\nThe project uses a tool called the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure implicit biases. The IAT measures the strength of associations between concepts (e.g., black people, gay people) and evaluations (e.g., good, bad) or stereotypes (e.g., athletic, clumsy). By comparing response times in associating these concepts, the IAT can provide an indication of implicit bias.\n\nFor instance, if a participant is quicker to associate 'black people' with 'bad' and 'white people' with 'good' than the reverse, this might indicate an implicit racial bias. Similarly, if a participant is quicker to associate 'women' with 'home' and 'men' with 'career' than the reverse, this might indicate an implicit gender bias.\n\nThe data collected through the IAT has been used in numerous research studies to explore the prevalence and impact of implicit biases. The project has also developed educational materials and resources to help individuals and organizations understand and address implicit biases.\n\nProject Implicit is hosted by Harvard University and is a collaboration between researchers from Harvard University, the University of Virginia, and the University of Washington. It has attracted millions of participants worldwide, making it one of the largest online behavioral research projects."}, {"prompt": "Who is Rudolf Virchow?

He is most widely known as \"the father of modern pathology\" for his concept of cellular pathology. \n\nBorn on October 13, 1821, in Schivelbein, Pomerania, Kingdom of Prussia (now \u015awidwin, Poland), Virchow studied medicine and chemistry in Berlin at the Military Academy of Medicine, from which he graduated in 1843. \n\nIn 1845, he became an assistant at the Charit\u00e9 hospital in Berlin. During this time, he developed his concept of cellular pathology, stating that all diseases originate from cells. This was a significant development, as it contradicted the prevalent belief that diseases arose from imbalances in the body's systems. \n\nVirchow made significant contributions to the understanding of thrombosis and embolism, coining the term 'thrombosis' and developing the concept of embolism. He was the first to explain that a pulmonary embolism was caused by blood clots originating from veins in the legs or pelvis, a condition now known as deep vein thrombosis.\n\nIn 1856, he became a professor at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin, where he continued his research and teaching. \n\nVirchow was also a social reformer, advocating for public health and education. He was elected to the Berlin City Council in 1859 and the Prussian House of Representatives in 1862. He played a significant role in developing the German Health Care system and was instrumental in the establishment of Germany's first meat inspection law, which set the precedent for regulating food safety.\n\nIn addition to his work in medicine and politics, Virchow was also a prolific writer and editor. He founded the medical journal \"Archiv f\u00fcr pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und f\u00fcr klinische Medizin\" (now known as \"Virchows Archiv\") in 1847, which is still published today. \n\nRudolf Virchow died on September 5, 1902, in Berlin, Germany. His work continues to be influential in the fields of medicine and public health."}, {"prompt": "What is the Stanley Cup?

It was first awarded in 1893 to the Montreal Hockey Club. The Cup is named after Lord Stanley of Preston, the 1892 Governor General of Canada, who donated it as an award to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. \n\nThe Stanley Cup is now awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff champion at the end of each season. The NHL took over the Cup in 1926. The first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup was the Ottawa Senators in 1927.\n\nThe Stanley Cup is made of silver and nickel alloy, stands 35.25 inches tall, weighs 34.5 pounds, and is made up of a bowl, a collar, and a barrel or chalice, with a series of tiered bands (or \"rings\") below. The winning team's names are engraved on these bands, and when a band becomes full, the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band is added to the bottom of the Cup.\n\nThe Cup has been awarded every year since 1893, except for 1919 because of the Spanish Flu epidemic, and 2005 due to the NHL lockout. \n\nSome of the most successful teams in Stanley Cup history include the Montreal Canadiens, who have won it 24 times, the Toronto Maple Leafs with 13 wins, and the Detroit Red Wings with 11 wins. \n\nThe tradition of each member of the winning team spending a day with the Cup began in the 1994-95 season by the New Jersey Devils. Players often take the Cup to their hometowns, share it with fans, family, and friends, and sometimes use it in surprising ways - for instance, it's been used to baptize children, and it's been taken to the top of mountains.\n\nThe Stanley Cup is unique among major sports trophies in that a new one is not made every year; instead, the winning team returns the trophy at the start of the next hockey season."}, {"prompt": "What is the movie 'Parasite'?
