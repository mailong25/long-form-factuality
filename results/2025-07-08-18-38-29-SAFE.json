It refers to Rudolf Virchow, but since \"his\" is not a full name, it qualifies as a vague reference.\n\n3. **Determine the proper entity**: From the RESPONSE, we see that \"Rudolf Virchow\" is the individual being discussed, and \"his\" refers to Rudolf Virchow. Therefore, we can replace \"his\" with \"Rudolf Virchow's\" to clarify the reference.\n\n4. **Revise the STATEMENT**: The revised statement should maintain the original meaning while replacing the vague reference with the proper entity.\n\nNow, let's construct the revised statement:\n\n```\nRudolf Virchow is known for his advancement in public health.\n```\n\nRevised with the proper entity:\n\n```\nRudolf Virchow is known for Rudolf Virchow's advancement in public health.\n``` \n\nHowever, this is not a natural phrasing.
