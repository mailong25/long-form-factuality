The airship was filled with hydrogen gas, which is highly flammable. As it approached the mooring mast, a spark\u2014likely caused by static electricity or a gas leak\u2014ignited the hydrogen. The fire rapidly engulfed the airship, causing it to crash in less than a minute.\n\nOf the 97 people on board (36 passengers and 61 crew), 35 died, along with one worker on the ground. The disaster was widely publicized, with dramatic newsreel footage and Herbert Morrison\u2019s famous radio broadcast capturing the event live. The tragedy marked the end of the airship era for passenger travel, as public confidence in hydrogen-filled dirigibles plummeted. The Hindenburg disaster remains one of the most infamous airship accidents in history."}, {"prompt": "Can you tell me about the European Investment Bank?
