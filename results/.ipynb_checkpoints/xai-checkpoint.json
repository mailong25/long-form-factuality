Its primary goal is to advance the understanding of implicit social cognition, which refers to the unconscious mental processes that influence our attitudes, stereotypes, and behaviors toward various social groups.\n\nSpecifically, the project aims to:\n\n- **Measure and study implicit biases:** Using tools like the Implicit Association Test (IAT), it collects data to explore how automatic associations in our minds can affect decisions in areas such as education, employment, and law enforcement.\n- **Raise awareness:** It educates participants about their own potential biases and the broader implications of implicit cognition on society, promoting efforts to reduce prejudice and discrimination.\n- **Conduct research:** The project gathers anonymous data from participants worldwide to contribute to scientific knowledge and inform interventions for fostering more equitable interactions.\n\nIf you'd like to participate or learn more, you can visit the official Project Implicit website (projectimplicit.net), where you can take tests and access resources for free. Keep in mind that while the IAT is a valuable tool, it's just one measure and should be interpreted in context."}, {"prompt": "Who is Jacques Derrida?", "correct_answers": [], "incorrect_answers": [], "side1_response": "[PLACEHOLDER RESPONSE]", "side2_response": "Jacques Derrida (1930\u20132004) was a influential French philosopher, literary theorist, and writer, widely regarded as one of the key figures in 20th-century continental philosophy. He is best known for developing the concept of \"deconstruction,\" a method of analyzing texts and ideas to uncover hidden assumptions, contradictions, and power structures. This approach challenged traditional Western philosophy by questioning the stability of meaning in language, suggesting that words and concepts are always open to interpretation and context.\n\n### Quick Background:\n- **Early Life**: Derrida was born on July 15, 1930, in El Biar, Algeria (then part of French colonial territory), to a Sephardic Jewish family. He grew up during a time of political upheaval, including World War II and the Algerian War, which influenced his views on identity, colonialism, and language.\n- **Education and Career**: He studied at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris and later taught at various institutions, including the University of California, Sorbonne, and Johns Hopkins University. His work spanned philosophy, literature, psychoanalysis, and even architecture.\n- **Key Ideas**: Derrida's philosophy, often associated with post-structuralism, emphasized concepts like \"diff\u00e9rance\" (a play on \"difference\" and \"deferral\"), which argues that meaning is never fixed but is always deferred and relational. He critiqued \"logocentrism,\" the idea that spoken or written language directly reflects truth or reality.\n\n### Impact and Legacy:\nDerrida's ideas have had a profound influence on fields beyond philosophy, including literary criticism, cultural studies, feminism, postcolonial theory, and even law and architecture. His work encouraged critical thinking about how language shapes our understanding of the world, making him a controversial yet transformative figure. Some of his major works include *Of Grammatology*, *Writing and Difference*, and *Specters of Marx*.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more, I can provide details on specific aspects of his philosophy, recommend books, or clarify how his ideas apply to modern topics.
