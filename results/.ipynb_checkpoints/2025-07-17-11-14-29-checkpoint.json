The project seeks to explore how these implicit biases influence perception, judgment, and behavior. By using tools like the Implicit Association Test (IAT), Project Implicit collects data from a wide range of participants to study the prevalence and impact of implicit biases across different social categories, such as race, gender, age, and more.

Born on July 15, 1930, in El Biar, Algeria, Derrida became one of the most influential figures in contemporary philosophy and literary theory. His work primarily addresses the relationship between text and meaning, challenging traditional assumptions about language, writing, and interpretation.\n\nDerrida's ideas have had a significant impact on a wide range of disciplines, including literature, law, anthropology, historiography, linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychoanalysis, political theory, and architecture. Some of his most notable works include \"Of Grammatology,\" \"Writing and Difference,\" and \"Margins of Philosophy.\"\n\nDeconstruction, the approach Derrida is most associated with, involves the critical examination of the inherent contradictions and assumptions in texts. It seeks to reveal the instability of meaning and the ways in which language can undermine its own claims to coherence and truth.\n\nDerrida's work is often seen as complex and challenging, and it has sparked both significant interest and controversy. He passed away on October 9, 2004, but his influence continues to be felt across various fields of study."}], "total_runtime": 5.383345365524292}
