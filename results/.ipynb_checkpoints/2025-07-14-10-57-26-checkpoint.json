His work has had a profound impact on a wide range of fields, including philosophy, literary theory, law, and architecture.\n\nDerrida's philosophy challenges the traditional assumptions about language, meaning, and interpretation. He argued that meaning is not fixed and that texts can be interpreted in multiple ways, often revealing contradictions and ambiguities. This approach seeks to uncover the underlying structures of thought and language that shape our understanding of the world.\n\nOne of his most famous concepts is \"diff\u00e9rance,\" a term he coined to describe the way meaning is always deferred and never fully present. He also critiqued the idea of binary oppositions (such as presence/absence, speech/writing) that dominate Western thought, suggesting that these oppositions are not as clear-cut as they seem.\n\nDerrida's major works include \"Of Grammatology,\" \"Writing and Difference,\" and \"Margins of Philosophy.\" His ideas have influenced post-structuralism, postmodernism, and various critical theories, making him a central figure in contemporary philosophy and critical thought."}, {"prompt": "What is the goal of Project Implicit, an online research project on implicit social cognition?", "correct_answers": [], "incorrect_answers": [], "side1_response": "[PLACEHOLDER RESPONSE]", "side2_response": "Project Implicit is an online research initiative aimed at understanding implicit social cognition, which refers to the attitudes and beliefs that people may hold unconsciously. The primary goals of Project Implicit include:\n\n1. **Research**: To investigate how implicit biases affect perceptions, judgments, and behaviors in various social contexts, such as race, gender, age, and other social categories.\n\n2. **Awareness**: To raise awareness about implicit biases and how they can influence decision-making and social interactions, often without individuals being aware of these biases.\n\n3. **Education**: To provide educational resources and tools that help individuals understand their own implicit biases and the broader implications of these biases in society.\n\n4. **Data Collection**: To gather data from participants through various online tests (such as the Implicit Association Test, or IAT) to contribute to the scientific understanding of implicit cognition.\n\nOverall, Project Implicit seeks to promote a better understanding of how implicit attitudes operate and their impact on social behavior, with the hope of fostering more equitable and informed social interactions."}, {"prompt": "Who is Rudolf Virchow?", "correct_answers": [], "incorrect_answers": [], "side1_response": "[PLACEHOLDER RESPONSE]", "side2_response": "Rudolf Virchow (1821\u20131902) was a prominent German physician, pathologist, and anthropologist, often referred to as the \"father of modern pathology.\" He made significant contributions to the understanding of disease processes and is best known for his formulation of the cell theory, which states that all cells arise from pre-existing cells. This was a crucial development in the field of biology and medicine.\n\nVirchow's work emphasized the importance of cellular pathology, which focused on the study of diseases at the cellular level. He introduced the concept that diseases are not just systemic but can be traced back to changes in individual cells. His famous phrase \"Omnis cellula e cellula,\" meaning \"every cell originates from another cell,\" encapsulates this idea.\n\nIn addition to his contributions to pathology, Virchow was also involved in social medicine and public health. He advocated for social reforms and was an outspoken critic of the social conditions that contributed to disease. He believed that health was influenced by social factors and worked to improve public health policies.\n\nVirchow was also a politician and served in the German parliament, where he used his platform to address issues related to health, education, and social justice. His legacy continues to influence medicine, pathology, and public health today."}, {"prompt": "What is the Stanley Cup?", "correct_answers": [], "incorrect_answers": [], "side1_response": "[PLACEHOLDER RESPONSE]", "side2_response": "The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff champion. It is one of the most prestigious trophies in professional sports and is named after Lord Stanley of Preston, the Governor General of Canada who donated the trophy in 1892. \n\nThe Stanley Cup is awarded following a playoff tournament that typically takes place in the spring, culminating in the Stanley Cup Final, where the two conference champions compete for the title. The trophy itself is made of silver and nickel alloy and has a distinctive design, featuring a bowl at the top and a series of bands that are engraved with the names of the winning players, coaches, and team staff.\n\nThe Stanley Cup is unique in that it is the only trophy in professional sports that is not permanently held by a single team; instead, it is passed from champion to champion each year. The tradition of the winning team celebrating with the Cup is a significant part of hockey culture, and players often take the trophy to their hometowns or share it with fans in various ways."}, {"prompt": "What is the movie 'Parasite'?", "correct_answers": [], "incorrect_answers": [], "side1_response": "[PLACEHOLDER RESPONSE]", "side2_response": "\"Parasite\" is a South Korean film directed by Bong Joon-ho, released in 2019.
