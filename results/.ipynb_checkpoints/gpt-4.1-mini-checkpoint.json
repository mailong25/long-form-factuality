Its goal is to reveal hidden biases individuals may not be aware of, promote awareness of how these biases affect social interactions, and contribute to research on reducing prejudice and discrimination. By providing accessible tools and collecting large-scale data, Project Implicit seeks to advance scientific knowledge about the nature, origins, and consequences of implicit attitudes."}, {"prompt": "Who is Jacques Derrida?

His work primarily focused on language, texts, and philosophy, questioning the idea that words have fixed, stable meanings. Derrida argued that meaning is always deferred and dependent on context, highlighting the inherent instability in language and concepts.\n\nHe engaged deeply with Western philosophy, particularly the works of Plato, Rousseau, and Heidegger, and his ideas influenced a wide range of fields including literary theory, law, anthropology, and architecture. Key works include *Of Grammatology* (1967), *Writing and Difference* (1967), and *Margins of Philosophy* (1972).\n\nDerrida\u2019s thought is often associated with post-structuralism and postmodernism, though he resisted simple categorization. His approach has been both highly influential and controversial, sparking debates about interpretation, authorship, and the nature of truth."}], "total_runtime": 4.525420427322388}
