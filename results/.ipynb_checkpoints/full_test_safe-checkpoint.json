The project was launched in 1998 by three scientists, Tony Greenwald from the University of Washington, Mahzarin Banaji from Harvard University, and Brian Nosek from the University of Virginia. \n\nThe goal of Project Implicit is to investigate thoughts and feelings that exist either outside of conscious awareness or outside of conscious control. These are known as implicit biases, which are often different from what people explicitly say they believe. The project seeks to understand the underlying causes and impacts of these biases on various aspects of life, such as decision making, behavior, and attitudes towards different social groups. \n\nThe project uses a tool called the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure implicit biases. The IAT measures the strength of associations between concepts (e.g., black people, gay people) and evaluations (e.g., good, bad) or stereotypes (e.g., athletic, clumsy). By comparing response times in associating these concepts, the IAT can provide an indication of implicit bias.\n\nFor instance, if a participant is quicker to associate 'black people' with 'bad' and 'white people' with 'good' than the reverse, this might indicate an implicit racial bias. Similarly, if a participant is quicker to associate 'women' with 'home' and 'men' with 'career' than the reverse, this might indicate an implicit gender bias.\n\nThe data collected through the IAT has been used in numerous research studies to explore the prevalence and impact of implicit biases. The project has also developed educational materials and resources to help individuals and organizations understand and address implicit biases.\n\nProject Implicit is hosted by Harvard University and is a collaboration between researchers from Harvard University, the University of Virginia, and the University of Washington. It has attracted millions of participants worldwide, making it one of the largest online behavioral research projects."}, {"prompt": "Who is Rudolf Virchow?

He is most widely known as \"the father of modern pathology\" for his concept of cellular pathology. \n\nBorn on October 13, 1821, in Schivelbein, Pomerania, Kingdom of Prussia (now \u015awidwin, Poland), Virchow studied medicine and chemistry in Berlin at the Military Academy of Medicine, from which he graduated in 1843. \n\nIn 1845, he became an assistant at the Charit\u00e9 hospital in Berlin. During this time, he developed his concept of cellular pathology, stating that all diseases originate from cells. This was a significant development, as it contradicted the prevalent belief that diseases arose from imbalances in the body's systems. \n\nVirchow made significant contributions to the understanding of thrombosis and embolism, coining the term 'thrombosis' and developing the concept of embolism. He was the first to explain that a pulmonary embolism was caused by blood clots originating from veins in the legs or pelvis, a condition now known as deep vein thrombosis.\n\nIn 1856, he became a professor at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin, where he continued his research and teaching. \n\nVirchow was also a social reformer, advocating for public health and education. He was elected to the Berlin City Council in 1859 and the Prussian House of Representatives in 1862. He played a significant role in developing the German Health Care system and was instrumental in the establishment of Germany's first meat inspection law, which set the precedent for regulating food safety.\n\nIn addition to his work in medicine and politics, Virchow was also a prolific writer and editor. He founded the medical journal \"Archiv f\u00fcr pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und f\u00fcr klinische Medizin\" (now known as \"Virchows Archiv\") in 1847, which is still published today. \n\nRudolf Virchow died on September 5, 1902, in Berlin, Germany. His work continues to be influential in the fields of medicine and public health."}], "total_runtime": 96.72160768508911, "autoeval_configs": {"debug_safe": "True", "max_retries": "3", "max_steps": "3", "max_tokens": "512", "model": "OPENAI:gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "model_short": "gpt_35_turbo", "model_temp": "0.1", "num_searches": "3", "search_type": "serper", "shared_config": "<module 'common.shared_config' from '/mnt/storage/longmai/diotima/long-form-factuality/common/shared_config.py'>"}}
