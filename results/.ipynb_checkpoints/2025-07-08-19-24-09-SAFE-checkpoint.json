The project was launched in 1998 by three scientists, Tony Greenwald from the University of Washington, Mahzarin Banaji from Harvard University, and Brian Nosek from the University of Virginia. \n\nThe goal of Project Implicit is to investigate thoughts and feelings that exist either outside of conscious awareness or outside of conscious control. These are known as implicit biases, which are often different from what people explicitly say they believe. The project seeks to understand the underlying causes and impacts of these biases on various aspects of life, such as decision making, behavior, and attitudes towards different social groups. \n\nThe project uses a tool called the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure implicit biases. The IAT measures the strength of associations between concepts (e.g., black people, gay people) and evaluations (e.g., good, bad) or stereotypes (e.g., athletic, clumsy). By comparing response times in associating these concepts, the IAT can provide an indication of implicit bias.\n\nFor instance, if a participant is quicker to associate 'black people' with 'bad' and 'white people' with 'good' than the reverse, this might indicate an implicit racial bias. Similarly, if a participant is quicker to associate 'women' with 'home' and 'men' with 'career' than the reverse, this might indicate an implicit gender bias.\n\nThe data collected through the IAT has been used in numerous research studies to explore the prevalence and impact of implicit biases. The project has also developed educational materials and resources to help individuals and organizations understand and address implicit biases.\n\nProject Implicit is hosted by Harvard University and is a collaboration between researchers from Harvard University, the University of Virginia, and the University of Washington. It has attracted millions of participants worldwide, making it one of the largest online behavioral research projects."}, {"prompt": "Who is Rudolf Virchow?

He is most widely known as \"the father of modern pathology\" for his concept of cellular pathology. \n\nBorn on October 13, 1821, in Schivelbein, Pomerania, Kingdom of Prussia (now \u015awidwin, Poland), Virchow studied medicine and chemistry in Berlin at the Military Academy of Medicine, from which he graduated in 1843. \n\nIn 1845, he became an assistant at the Charit\u00e9 hospital in Berlin. During this time, he developed his concept of cellular pathology, stating that all diseases originate from cells. This was a significant development, as it contradicted the prevalent belief that diseases arose from imbalances in the body's systems. \n\nVirchow made significant contributions to the understanding of thrombosis and embolism, coining the term 'thrombosis' and developing the concept of embolism. He was the first to explain that a pulmonary embolism was caused by blood clots originating from veins in the legs or pelvis, a condition now known as deep vein thrombosis.\n\nIn 1856, he became a professor at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin, where he continued his research and teaching. \n\nVirchow was also a social reformer, advocating for public health and education. He was elected to the Berlin City Council in 1859 and the Prussian House of Representatives in 1862. He played a significant role in developing the German Health Care system and was instrumental in the establishment of Germany's first meat inspection law, which set the precedent for regulating food safety.\n\nIn addition to his work in medicine and politics, Virchow was also a prolific writer and editor. He founded the medical journal \"Archiv f\u00fcr pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und f\u00fcr klinische Medizin\" (now known as \"Virchows Archiv\") in 1847, which is still published today. \n\nRudolf Virchow died on September 5, 1902, in Berlin, Germany. His work continues to be influential in the fields of medicine and public health."}, {"prompt": "What is the Stanley Cup? Provide as many specific details and examples as possible (such as names of people, numbers, events, locations, dates, times, etc.)", "correct_answers": [], "incorrect_answers": [], "side1_response": "[PLACEHOLDER RESPONSE]", "side2_response": "The Stanley Cup is the oldest existing trophy in North American professional sports. It was first awarded in 1893 to the Montreal Hockey Club. The Cup is named after Lord Stanley of Preston, the 1892 Governor General of Canada, who donated it as an award to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. \n\nThe Stanley Cup is now awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff champion at the end of each season. The NHL took over the Cup in 1926. The first NHL team to win the Stanley Cup was the Ottawa Senators in 1927.\n\nThe Stanley Cup is made of silver and nickel alloy, stands 35.25 inches tall, weighs 34.5 pounds, and is made up of a bowl, a collar, and a barrel or chalice, with a series of tiered bands (or \"rings\") below. The winning team's names are engraved on these bands, and when a band becomes full, the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band is added to the bottom of the Cup.\n\nThe Cup has been awarded every year since 1893, except for 1919 because of the Spanish Flu epidemic, and 2005 due to the NHL lockout. \n\nSome of the most successful teams in Stanley Cup history include the Montreal Canadiens, who have won it 24 times, the Toronto Maple Leafs with 13 wins, and the Detroit Red Wings with 11 wins. \n\nThe tradition of each member of the winning team spending a day with the Cup began in the 1994-95 season by the New Jersey Devils. Players often take the Cup to their hometowns, share it with fans, family, and friends, and sometimes use it in surprising ways - for instance, it's been used to baptize children, and it's been taken to the top of mountains.\n\nThe Stanley Cup is unique among major sports trophies in that a new one is not made every year; instead, the winning team returns the trophy at the start of the next hockey season."}, {"prompt": "What is the movie 'Parasite'?

The film was released in 2019 and it premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival on May 21, where it won the Palme d'Or, becoming the first Korean film to win the award and the first film to do so with a unanimous vote since 2013's \"Blue Is the Warmest Colour\". \n\nThe movie features a cast that includes Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Jang Hye-jin, and Lee Jung-eun. The plot revolves around two families, the wealthy Park family and the poor Kim family. The Kim family, which consists of Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), his wife Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), their son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam), live in a small semi-basement apartment and struggle to make ends meet. When Ki-woo gets an opportunity to tutor the daughter of the wealthy Park family, they scheme to infiltrate the wealthy household by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.\n\nThe movie is set in South Korea, in various locations including the wealthy Park family's luxurious modernist home and the Kim family's semi-basement apartment in a poor neighborhood. The contrast between these two settings is a significant element in the film, symbolizing the economic disparity and class struggle in South Korea.\n\n\"Parasite\" was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $266 million worldwide on a production budget of about $11 million. It received numerous awards and nominations, including six nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards. It made history by winning four awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film. It became the first South Korean film to win the Palme d'Or and the first non-English language film to win the Best Picture Oscar."}], "total_runtime": 96.72160768508911, "autoeval_configs": {"debug_safe": "True", "max_retries": "5", "max_steps": "5", "max_tokens": "512", "model": "OPENAI:gpt-4o-mini", "model_short": "gpt_4", "model_temp": "0.0", "num_searches": "5", "search_type": "serper", "shared_config": "<module 'common.shared_config' from '/mnt/storage/longmai/diotima/long-form-factuality/common/shared_config.py'>"}}
