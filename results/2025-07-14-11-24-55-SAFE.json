This suggests that attitudes and beliefs can exist in a form that is not accessible to conscious thought.\n\n3. **Influence of Past Experiences**: The text mentions that past experiences can influence judgment in ways that the individual does not introspectively know. This reinforces the idea that there are cognitive processes at play that are not consciously recognized.\n\n4. **Importance of Implicit Association Test (IAT)**: The IAT is highlighted as a significant measure in social psychology for assessing these implicit attitudes and biases, further supporting the notion that attitudes can be held unconsciously.\n\nNow, let's connect these points to the STATEMENT:\n\nThe STATEMENT asserts that \"Attitudes and beliefs related to implicit social cognition may be held unconsciously.\" This aligns perfectly with the KNOWLEDGE, which emphasizes that implicit biases and attitudes operate outside of conscious awareness.
